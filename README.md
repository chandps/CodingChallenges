# Coding Challenges
Collection of my solution from various Code & Algorithm challenges.

## Usage

I use C++14 and python 3.5 in all of my c++ & python code.
Add `-std=c++14` command-line flag if you are using GCC.

Code & Algorithm challenges are grouped based on directories:

`CIBootcamp/`
`CtCi/`
`Hackerrank/`
`cdlt/`
`gfg/`
`intcake/`
`sandbox/`
`topcoder/`

More solution to be added later:
- [ ] CodeChef
- [ ] SPOJ
- [ ] Coderbyte
- [ ] ProjectEuler
- [ ] Codewars
