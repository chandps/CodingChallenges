<p>
    1. its not neccessary to create N space huge array that could contain all the input possibilities,
    just create least amount of array size that POSSIBLE to the result and filter the input
    2. check every input whether its out of range or not
    3. if can run once while checking every constraint, then maximize that by running just once
    4. it doesn't make any significant difference in running time to run twice N (only 0.01s more slower)
